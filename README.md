Mall Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering (Data Science Project)
# Mall Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project focuses on segmenting mall customers into distinct groups based on their **Annual Income** and **Spending Score** using the **K-Means clustering algorithm**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
- Applied **K-Means Clustering** to identify 5 customer segments.
- Performed **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)** with Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- Visualized customer clusters to help businesses target the right customers.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Pandas & NumPy (Data handling)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (Visualization)
- Scikit-learn (K-Means Clustering)

---

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used is `Mall_Customers.csv`, which includes:
- CustomerID
- Gender
- Age
- Annual Income (k$)
- Spending Score (1–100)

---

## 🚀 Steps Followed
1. Data Loading and Cleaning  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Visualizing distributions (Age, Income, Spending Score)  
4. Applying **Elbow Method** to find optimal clusters (k=5)  
5. Performing **K-Means Clustering**  
6. Visualizing clusters (scatter plot)  
7. Analyzing customer segments  

---

## 📊 Results (Customer Segments)
- **Cluster 0:** High income, low spending → Careful Customers  
- **Cluster 1:** Low income, high spending → Target Customers  
- **Cluster 2:** Average income & spending → Moderate Customers  
- **Cluster 3:** High income, high spending → VIP Customers  
- **Cluster 4:** Low income, low spending → Budget Customers
